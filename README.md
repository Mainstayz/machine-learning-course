## Solutions for the assignments of THE machine learning course.

ex1: Linear regression, solving with gradient descent, solving with normal equation, feature normalization, learning rates and rates of gradient descent

ex2: Logistic regression, regularized logistic regression, polynomial feature mapping

_Please note, that putting solutions for the assignments here publicly is not a violation of Coursera's Honor Code, because solutions are written with different programming language and tools (Python, numpy, scipy, matplotlib, etc.) than what's required to complete assignments and receive grading for the course._
